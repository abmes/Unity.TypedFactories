[![abmes MyGet Build Status](https://www.myget.org/BuildSource/Badge/abmes?identifier=ba7fbde8-f2fb-41e1-a718-a4b21f3042db)](https://www.myget.org/)

This project is a fork of Pedro Pombeiro's [Unity.TypedFactories project](https://github.com/PombeirP/Unity.TypedFactories) which provides automatic Abstract Factory functionality similar to Castle.Windsor Typed Factories, for the Unity IoC container.
Some additions are implemented to support Unity's named registrations and injection members.
